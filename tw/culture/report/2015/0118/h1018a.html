                <h2>Chou Hsi-wei joins other New Taipei City heads on wall</h2>
                <h3>Chen Wei-han｜Taipei Times／Taiwan News∣Jan 18, 2015</h3>
                <p>The final piece in New Taipei City’s hall of fame, the portrait of former Taipei County commissioner Chou Hsi-wei (周錫瑋), was finally put up at New Taipei City Hall last week, five years after he retired from the post in 2010.</p>
                <p>Cultural Affairs Department division chief Chen Chun-mei (陳春美) said that it was a tradition to capture the image of city heads on canvas and have their images adorn the walls of city hall, as the portraits symbolize the city’s history.</p>
                <p>However, the tradition came to a halt when Chou, a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), turned down the city government’s requests to have a portrait of him made.</p>
                <p>Chou’s portrait had been missing from the gallery for four years since Taipei County was upgraded to New Taipei City in 2010.</p>
                <p>Later, Chou finally agreed to be depicted by artist Chen Yuan-cheng (陳員成), who spent three months completing the oil painting in which Chou, in a blue suit, smiles warmly.</p>
                <p>Currently on display on the fifth floor of city hall are replicas of portraits by the late master painter Li Mei-shu (李梅樹) of four former Taipei County commissioners, including Mei Ta-fu (梅達夫), Tai Te-fa (戴德發), Hsieh Wen-cheng (謝文程) and Su Ching-po (蘇清波) all members of the KMT.</p>
                <p>The originals reside in the New Taipei City Art Center collection.</p>
                <p>Chen succeeded Li for the portraits of former Taipei County commissioners Shao En-shin (卲恩新) and Lin Fong-cheng (林豐正) of the KMT, as well as You Ching (尤清), Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) and former acting commissioner Lin Hsi-yao (林錫耀) of the Democratic Progressive Party. The portraits are on display on the sixth floor of city hall.</p>
